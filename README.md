# Project 2: GIPHY API

### NOTE: This is source code, not built code. The built deliverables according to the spec (`index.html`, `js/main.js` and `css/style.css`) are on the branch `gh-pages`.

Name: Sara Gharagozlou

Overview: This project uses the GIPHY API to show trending gifs in a masonry grid on the home page, allows the user to type in a search term to search GIPHY for gifs in the search page, and shows a basic about page to provide a third menu option.

Details: Use the top navigation menu to switch between trending, search and about tabs. Type in the search bar and press enter or click "search" to search for gifs.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite, TailwindCSS

Ideas for future improvement:

- Show trending search terms to make searching easier
- Actually make an informative About page
- Allow users to see metadata for gifs
